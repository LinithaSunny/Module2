//generation type is a strategy which a jpa should use or follow to generate primary key values
	//the default generation type is AUTO. WHEN A STARTEGY IS NOT SPECIFIED JPA USES AUTO STARTEGY.
	// WHEN THE UNDERLINED DATABASE IS MYSQL GENERATIONType.AUTO means, the jpa will create a hibernate sequence in the
	//database for generation of primary keys
	//GenerationType.IDENTITY - for this strategy to work first we have to create a table in mysql and explicitly specify the auto increment
	//(AI) as checked for the primary key column 
	// and in application.properties file spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update - this should not be set,if it is set it should have value as update
	/*
	 * select next_val as id_val from hibernate_sequence for update
	Hibernate: update hibernate_sequence set next_val= ? where next_val=?
	Hibernate: insert into product (description, name, price, qty, product_id) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
