                                    As part of a study, researchers have defined five main personality traits of cats ('Feline Five'), each of which summarises a large number of related traits. The research team grouped them under the terms neuroticism, extraversion, dominance, impulsivity and tolerance. Each of these characteristics can be developed to different extents.
                    
                    Every cat has all of these characteristics, but in different markedness. When evaluating your own cat, the extremes are interesting and important. If your animal has unusually high or low values for a factor.
