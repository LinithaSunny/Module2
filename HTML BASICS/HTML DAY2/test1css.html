                As part of a study, researchers have defined five main personality traits of cats ('Feline Five'), each of which summarises a large number of related traits. 
                                                                                                The research team grouped them under the terms neuroticism, extraversion, dominance, impulsivity and tolerance. Each of these characteristics can be developed to different extents.

                <span>Every cat has all of these characteristics, but in different markedness.
                </span>
                When evaluating your own cat, the extremes are interesting and important. If your animal has unusually high or low values for a factor.
