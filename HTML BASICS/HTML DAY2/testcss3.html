                    Scientists once rejected the idea that cats, like animals in general, have personalities. Over time however, it has been recognised that it is important to be able to recognise and assess the personalities of cats, because this can result in better keeping and care of the animal. If both are adapted to the character of the cat, it ensures or improves both the well-being and the health of the cat and increases its quality of life.

The research team grouped them under the terms neuroticism, extraversion, dominance, impulsivity and tolerance. Each of these characteristics can be developed to different extents.

When evaluating your own cat, the extremes are interesting and important. If your animal has unusually high or low values for a factor.
